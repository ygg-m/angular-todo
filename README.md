# Todo Angular Project

This is a Todo Angular project that utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling, Angular version 17.2.0 for frontend development, and Supabase for authentication and storage.

## Features

- Manage your todos easily with this intuitive web application.
- Stylish UI design powered by Tailwind CSS.
- Seamless authentication and data storage provided by Supabase.

## Technologies Used

- Angular 17.2.0: Angular is a popular front-end framework for building single-page web applications. It provides a robust structure for development, data binding, and dependency injection.

- Supabase: Supabase is an open-source alternative to Firebase that provides a suite of tools for building scalable web applications. It offers authentication, real-time database, file storage, and more.
