# Angular 17 Todo App

This project is a Todo application built with Angular 17. It allows users to manage their tasks by providing features such as adding, completing, editing, filtering, and deleting todos. The application integrates with Firebase for authentication and data storage. Additionally, it supports guest mode, where users can use local storage to store their todos without requiring authentication.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Users can register, login, and reset their passwords securely using Firebase Authentication.
- **Data Management**: Todos are stored in Firebase Firestore, providing real-time synchronization across devices.
- **Guest Mode**: Users can use the application without authentication by storing their todos locally in the browser's local storage.
- **Todo Management**: Users can add new todos, mark todos as completed, edit existing todos, filter todos based on their completion status, and delete todos.

## Technologies Used
